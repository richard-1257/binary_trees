Binary Trees Project

This project is a collaboration between Richard Ifeanyi and Nwachukwu Onyinyechi to implement and explore the use of binary trees in various applications.

Project Overview
A binary tree is a tree data structure in which each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child. Binary trees have a wide range of applications in computer science, including binary search trees, expression trees, Huffman coding, and more.

The main goal of this project is to implement binary trees in different applications and explore their use cases. The project will consist of several modules that will be implemented by both team members. The modules include:

Binary search tree
Expression tree
Huffman coding
AVL tree
Red-black tree
Each module will be implemented in Python, and will include unit tests to ensure correctness.
